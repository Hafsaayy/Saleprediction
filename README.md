# Saleprediction
Sale Prediction System
This project is a sale prediction system that aims to predict the sales of local shops using a dataset. The goal of this system is to help increase sales, which can in turn help decrease poverty.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of following data:
order id
order date
ship date
ship mode
customer id
customer name etc

# Requirements
This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed on your system. You can download and install Jupyter Notebook from here.

# Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

# install the following:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Running the Project

# To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.
Open the Sale Prediction Untitled.ipynb file.
Run the code cells in the notebook.
The notebook will load the dataset, clean the data, and train a machine learning model to predict sales. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data.

# Conclusion

The sale prediction system is a valuable tool for local shops to help increase sales and reduce poverty in the community. By accurately predicting sales, shops can better manage their inventory and pricing strategies, which can lead to increased revenue and profitability. We hope that this project can make a positive impact on local businesses and contribute to the overall economic growth of the community.
